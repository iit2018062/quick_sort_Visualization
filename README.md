quick_sort_Visualization

In this code i have tried to show quick sort visualization using python 
It is very easy to understand an algorithm like quicksort using visual analysis.
My approach includes:
1. taking an array of random numbers which are generated by a function 
2. then the quicksort function is called which helps to sort the array and then it is dispalyed in screen using different color

Green – Unsorted bar
Blue – Pivot bar
Orange – Sorted bar
